    <h1>Four-Wheel Driving Safety Instructions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Always Wear Your Seatbelt:</li>
        <p>Before you start your four-wheel drive adventure, make sure all occupants are wearing their seatbelts. Seatbelts are essential for safety in case of sudden stops or accidents.</p>

        <li>2. Know Your Vehicle:</li>
        <p>Understanding the features and capabilities of your four-wheel drive vehicle is crucial. Read the owner's manual and know how to engage and disengage 4WD, use differential locks, and operate other vehicle-specific features.</p>

        <li>3. Plan Your Route:</li>
        <p>Before heading out, plan your route and let someone know your plans, including expected arrival times. Be aware of the terrain, weather conditions, and any potential hazards along the way.</p>

        <li>4. Drive Slow and Steady:</li>
        <p>When off-roading, drive at a safe and controlled speed. Four-wheel drive vehicles are designed for rough terrain, but it's important to take it slow to avoid accidents and vehicle damage.</p>

        <li>5. Observe Road Conditions:</li>
        <p>Keep an eye on road conditions, including mud, sand, rocks, and water crossings. Drive cautiously and use appropriate gear or settings for the terrain you encounter.</p>

        <li>6. Be Prepared for Emergencies:</li>
        <p>Carry essential safety equipment such as a first aid kit, fire extinguisher, spare tire, tools, and recovery gear like tow straps. It's also a good idea to have extra water and food on hand.</p>

        <li>7. Respect the Environment:</li>
        <p>Drive responsibly and follow all off-roading regulations. Avoid damaging the natural environment and stay on designated trails to preserve the ecosystem.</p>

        <li>8. Maintain Communication:</li>
        <p>Carry a means of communication, such as a mobile phone or a two-way radio, to call for help in case of an emergency.</p>
